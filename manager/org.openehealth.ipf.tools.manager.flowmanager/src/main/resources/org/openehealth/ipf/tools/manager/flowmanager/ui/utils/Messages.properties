manage.options.check.filter=Filter flow duplicates
manage.options.check.filter.tooltip= Filter flow duplicates (filtering) recognizes replayed messages that have already be delivered to an external destination and filter them out.

manage.options.check.cleanup=Cleanup acknowledged flows
manage.options.check.cleanup.tooltip=Cleanup acknowledged flows (cleanup) controls whether a flow shall be cleaned up if the number of expected acknowledgements are reached.\nCleanup means that the initial message exchange used to start the flow is removed from the flow object in the database.\nThis saves disk space and still allows clients to retrieve the flow history.\nHowever, a replay of cleaned-up message exchanges is not possible any more because this requires the initial message exchange object.\n WARNING: The flows, that are acknowledged while the \"Cleanup acknowledged flows\" is unchecked, will never be cleaned!  
manage.options.button.apply=Apply
manage.options.label.maxflows=Limit number of result flows to: 
manage.options.maxflows.tooltip=The number of result flows attribute limits the result set size of flow finders or flow queries.\nBy default the maximum number of returned flows is 100.\nIf a query finds more than 100 flows in the database then only the 100 most recent flows will be shown.

manage.options.refresh.delay.tooltip=Replaying flows, puts the flows in a message queue and processes the messages asynchronously. \nIf the flow has not reached its final destination (is in a queue), a status for the flow could return wrong results. \nThe delay gives a time tolerance before the search flows command is executed, after the flow is being replayed.
