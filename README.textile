The IPF Tools project focuses tools around the eHealth Integration Framework "IPF":http://github.com/krasserm/ipf.

One category of tools are related to OSGi and the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP):

* The "IPF runtime":http://repo.openehealth.org/confluence/display/ipftools/IPF+Runtime is an IPF distribution that is running on the Equinox OSGi platform. It is available as Eclipse plugin or as standalone package. The runtime is used to develop OSGi-based IPF applications.
* The "IPF IDE":http://repo.openehealth.org/confluence/display/ipftools/IPF+IDE supports developers in creating, testing and packaging IPF applications within the Eclipse plugin development environment (PDE) on top of the IPF runtime.
* The "IPF manager":http://repo.openehealth.org/confluence/display/ipftools/IPF+Manager is an Eclipse plugin for managing IPF platform and application resources. 

Another category is related to Maven:

* The maven-dsldoc plugin is used to generate GDSL descriptors for IntelliJ IDEA. These support the IDE doing code completion for IPF DSL extensions.
